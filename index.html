      About Me  <br />
      <small>
        My name is Neil Rajendran and I am one year out of Georgia State. At Georgia State I received my exericse science degree. However after completing my internship in physical therapy, I decided this was not my career path. I soon began at the healthcare IT company, athenahealth. At athenhealth I worked in business development and really thrived there. I led my team with 208 meetings and $1.6 million in revenue. Now I am looking to develop my technical skills and gain a robust programming knowledge. I hope to blend my business background and innate personality with an extensive technical skills. My goal is to become the liason between the business and developer branch.  I also love soccer and played my entire life.
